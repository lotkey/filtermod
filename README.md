# The Filter Mod

## About

Filter is a very simple mod that adds... filters. They are just like regular hoppers but they can be used to only pull certain items.

## Crafting

## Using

The filter uses an allowlist to conditionally allow certain items to pass through. A filter with an empty allowlist will function as a regular hopper.

![Filter Inventory](./docs/inventories.png)

Adding items to the allowlist will make the filter only allow those items to pass through.

![Filter Allowlist](./docs/allowlist.png)

The above configuration will only allow redstone, hoppers, and copper ingots to pass through the filter.
